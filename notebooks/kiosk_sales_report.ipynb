    "# Kiosk Sales Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze sales data from a kiosk that offers various products, such as candies, beverages, cigarettes, and other items. By applying the CRISP-DM methodology, we systematically approach the data analysis process to extract valuable insights that can help increase sales and improve the kioskâ€™s overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis followed the six phases of CRISP-DM: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. Each phase was crucial to ensure a thorough analysis and results applicable to the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The following visualizations summarize the most significant results of the analysis. These include the distribution of sales by category, sales trends over time, and the performance of predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Distribution of Total Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the distribution of total sales reveals the following observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Right-Skewed Distribution: The total sales distribution is asymmetric, with a clear rightward trend. Most total sales are concentrated in low values, indicating that most transactions involve smaller amounts.\n",
    "* High Frequency in Low Sales: The highest volume of sales is found in the range of 0 to 25 units, with the highest frequency around 100 transactions in the lowest interval. This suggests that small sales are common and dominate the distribution.\n",
    "* Gradual Decrease in Higher Sales: As total sales values increase, their frequency gradually decreases. Sales exceeding 100 units are much less frequent, with a marked decline as the sales value increases.\n",
    "* Long Tail Towards Higher Sales: There are some higher sales transactions, though they are much less common. This long tail may be influenced by outliers or unique high-value sales.\n",
    " \n",
    "In summary, the right-skewed distribution and high frequency of small sales suggest that the business primarily consists of lower-value transactions. Identifying strategies to increase the average sale amount could be an opportunity to boost total sales."

    "### 2.3. Sales Trends Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of total sales over time reveals the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variability in Daily Sales: Total sales show considerable variability across days, with frequent fluctuations between consecutive days. This indicates an inconsistent sales pattern, which could be influenced by external factors such as promotions, special events, or changes in market demand.\n",
    "- Notable Sales Peaks: Significant sales peaks are observed on 06-28, 07-06, 07-15, and 07-18, with the highest reaching close to 3,000 units on 07-18. These peaks might correspond to periods of high demand or successful promotional activities.\n",
    "- Days with Low Sales: In contrast, the lowest sales are recorded on 07-01, 07-10, and 07-21, with a notable drop on 07-21 where sales fall below 1,000 units. These low sales days could represent opportunities to investigate underlying causes and adjust strategies.\n",
    "- Overall Trend: Despite high variability, there is a slight upward trend in sales from late June to mid-July, suggesting a gradual increase in demand during this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the data show high volatility in daily sales with several peaks and troughs. Identifying the factors driving high peaks and sharp declines could be key to optimizing sales strategy and improving performance consistency."

    "\n",
    "A correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between different variables in the dataset. The following key results were observed in the correlation matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Relationship Between Quantity and Other Variables\n",
    "    - Quantity shows a strong positive correlation with Total Sale (0.74) and Taxes (0.68). This indicates that as the quantity sold increases, both total sales and associated taxes tend to rise significantly.\n",
    "    - A moderate positive correlation with Discounts (0.49) is also observed, suggesting that higher quantities sold are related to applied discounts, which could indicate volume discount strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Relationship Between Unit Price and Other Variables\n",
    "    - Unit Price has a low correlation with Quantity (0.0056), indicating that the unit price does not directly influence the quantity sold.\n",
    "    - However, there is a positive correlation with Total Sale and Taxes, which is expected, as higher unit prices should lead to higher total sales and consequently higher taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Negative Relationships\n",
    "    - A negative relationship is observed between Remaining Stock and Day (-0.40), which could reflect a trend of decreasing remaining stock as the day progresses or over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results provide an overview of how variables are interrelated and can guide decisions on pricing policies, inventory management, and sales strategies."
